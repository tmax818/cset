- create a schedule and interleave topics. I haven't been doing this. 


>**Spaced Learning:** study a topic for short, spaced-out, intervals. This helps the brain to process and retain complex concepts better, improving long-term memory (while cramming all at once relies on short-term memory).

>**Interleaving**: Mix up related topics in a session. Studies have shown that practicing math questions in this mixed-up way helps you remember and use what you've learned better. It also helps you relate different concepts.
