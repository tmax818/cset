\paragraph*{quartiles}

Quartiles are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters.

$$ Q2 = median $$

\paragraph*{range}

The \textbf{range} is the difference between the lowest and highest values.

\paragraph*{interquartile range}

\paragraph*{standard deviation}

The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out (distributed) numbers are. The standard deviation is the square-root of the \textbf{variance}.
