\section[Euclidean Geometry]{Plane Euclidean Geometry}

\say{Candidates demonstrate an understanding of the foundations of geometry as outlined in the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (Grade 7, Grade 8, and High School). Candidates demonstrate a depth and breadth of conceptual knowledge to ensure a rigorous view of geometry and its underlying structures. They demonstrate an understanding of \textbf{axiomatic systems} and different forms of \textbf{logical arguments}. Candidates understand, apply, and \textbf{prove theorems} relating to a variety of topics in \textbf{two- and three-dimensional geometry}, including \textbf{coordinate}, \textbf{synthetic}, \textbf{non-Euclidean}, and \textbf{transformational geometry}.}
