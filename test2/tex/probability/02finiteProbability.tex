\subsection[Finite Probability]{Finite Probability}

\textit{Illustrate finite probability using a variety of examples and models (e.g., the fundamental counting principles, sample space)}

\paragraph*{fundamental counting principle} 

If there are p ways to do one thing and q ways to do another thing, then there are $ p \times q $ ways to do both things. This is known as the \textit{fundamental counting principle}(fcp). The fcp only works if the choices are independent of each other.

\paragraph*{sample space}

All the possible outcomes of an experiment is known as the \textbf{sample space}.
